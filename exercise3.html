            Hello! My name is Ryan Strong. I am from Frederick, Colorado! Its a small town, very near boulder. Living this
            close to the mountians has invited me to fall in love with them. I have climbed 13 big mountains in colorado. The beauty
            and adventure of the climb is unparalleled in life. When I left Colorado for KU I seemed, in a way, torn in two. I often 
            dream of the mountains and what peak I'll climb next when I get back to Colorado. 
        </p>
        <p class="biography">
                While I am here at Ku, I study Interdisciplinary Computing - Biology. This degree allows me to study computer science 
            and biology at the same time. My plan is to attend medical school and use my technology and medical skills to save lives.
